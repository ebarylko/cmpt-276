# Notes
## Prototype
The prototype will include the ability to add, edit, and 
delete issues. 

The prototype can list all issues and filter issues based 
on release version, product, status, and users who reported 
this issue.

The user will be able to add new releases for a product.

The user can have all the recently created issues listed 
for them (ask what time frame the professor wants)



## Future features

You can now assign one or many people to an issue

Issues will record how long they were kept opened, how
many times the due date was extended, and how much the 
due date was extended in order to show statistics 
regarding the average times an issue is kept open, how 
much an issue is extended by, and how many times the 
due date was modified.

All users will be authenticated before being allowed to 
access issues.

Permissions will be seperated to allow users to only 
write feature requests and not modify issues in any way.

Integration with various tools, e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub, Monday,
Jira, ....

History of changes to an issue.

Allowing multiple users to access the system concurrently.

Allow teams to have multiple projects open which they 
can access.

# Actual content

## Prototype features
In a prototype, the following will be unavailable:
- authentication of users
- assigning developers to issues
- obtaining information on the average time an issue stays open for a specific product
- integration with other tools, such as Jira or GitHub

## Future features

For the future versions of the system, an issue will have 
a field for assignees, noting who is currently working on 
the issue. 

Furthermore, a user will be able to request more information
about the average time an issue takes, the average number of 
modifications to the due date of an issue, and the average 
number of days an issue gets extended by. This information 
will be available in each product, allowing the 
user to generate a list of these statistics for 
each product. Moreover, this information will get updated 
with each following issue that gets opened and closed.
We believe this feature will enable software 
developers and managers to have more information to use 
when giving estimates, aiding them in making accurate 
predictions.

Future releases will also allow multiple users to use the 
issue tracking system concurrently, create multiple 
projects, and to use the system with a graphical interface.
