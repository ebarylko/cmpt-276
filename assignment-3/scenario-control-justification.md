Nature of your overall scenario design strategy and scenario control location policy: either
distributed in a roundabout manner, distributed in a principal-object-rooted manner,
centralized in the UI or scenario modules, or centralized in principle object modules. Why
did you choose this architecture?


The scenario design strategy that will be used is the principal-object method. This method 
was selected since the principal object knows best what information it requires to complete  
the scenario it is in. Considering this, having the principal object initiate and control the 
calls to the other modules seemed like a logical decision.
