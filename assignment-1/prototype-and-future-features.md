## Prototype features
In a prototype, the following will be unavailable:
- authentication of users
- assigning developers to issues
- obtaining information on the average time an issue stays open for a specific product
- integration with other tools, such as Jira or GitHub

## Future features

For the future versions of the system, an issue will have 
a field for assignees, noting who is currently working on 
the issue. 

Furthermore, a user will be able to request more information
about the average time an issue takes, the average number of 
modifications to the due date of an issue, and the average 
number of days an issue gets extended by. This information 
will be available in each product, allowing the 
user to generate a list of these statistics for 
each product. Moreover, this information will get updated 
with each following issue that gets opened and closed.
We believe this feature will enable software 
developers and managers to have more information to use 
when giving estimates, aiding them in making accurate 
predictions.

Future releases will also allow multiple users to use the 
issue tracking system concurrently, create multiple 
projects, and to use the system with a graphical interface.
