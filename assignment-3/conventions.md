For all files in this project, the following conventions will be 
observed:
* Each file will have its name at the very top of the file
* Every major section (revision history, imports, classes, functions, etc..) will be separated by ------------
*  The revision history will be of the form
```
Revision # - mm/dd/yyyy modified by [editor/s]
           - changes made 
```
* The revision history will be in reverse chronological order
* The revision history will be followed by a paragraph explaining what the file contains
* Functions and their parameters are in camel case
* Place all the arguments of a function on a separate line and add a comment indicating if they are in or out parameters
* Use four spaces for indenting function parameters
* Classes are in pascal case
* Constants are in screaming snake case
* Four spaces are used for indentations
* For curly braces, put the opening brace at the end of the line where the construct begins, and the closing brace on a separate line aligned horizontally with the opening construct.
* Put spaces around binary operators, except the range operator
* Always put a space after ":"
* If the condition of an if or when statement is multiline, always use curly braces around the body of the statement 
* Indent each subsequent line of the condition by four spaces relative to the statement start
* Put the closing parentheses of the condition together with the opening curly brace on a separate line:
* When wrapping chained calls, put the . character or the ?. operator on the next line, with a single indent:
