## Development environment

The only requirement for our software is that 
it must be able to run at least Java 8. The software 
will be developed using Windows and MacOS, but will 
be runnable on the two operating systems previously 
mentioned plus the Linux operating system.

## Maintenance environment

The source code will be delivered to the client and will 
be maintained by (name our group) for a period of one year.
All updates to the system can be applied while the system 
is running.

If a new release requires the customer's information to 
be migrated, it will be done.
