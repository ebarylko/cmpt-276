# Notes
## Prototype
The prototype will include the ability to add, edit, and 
delete issues. 

The prototype can list all issues and filter issues based 
on release version, product, status, and users who reported 
this issue.

The user will be able to add new releases for a product.

The user can have all the recently created issues listed 
for them (ask what time frame the professor wants)



## Future features

You can now assign one or many people to an issue

Issues will record how long they were kept opened, how
many times the due date was extended, and how much the 
due date was extended in order to show statistics 
regarding the average times an issue is kept open, how 
much an issue is extended by, and how many times the 
due date was modified.

All users will be authenticated before being allowed to 
access issues.

Permissions will be seperated to allow users to only 
write feature requests and not modify issues in any way.

Integration with various tools, e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub, Monday,
Jira, ....

History of changes to an issue.

Allowing multiple users to access the system concurrently.

Allow teams to have multiple projects open which they 
can access.

# Actual content

## Prototype features
In the prototype, the user will be able to create, edit, and
delete issues. Additionally, the user will be able to 
list issues and filter them by a variety of options, 
including the product associated with the issue,
the status of the issue, and the user who reported the 
issue.

Asides from issues, a user will be able to create new
products and release versions for a product.

## Future features


For the future versions of the system, an issue will have 
a field for assignees, noting who is currently working on 
the issue. 

Furthermore, a user will be able to request more information
about how long issues relating to a certain product stay 
open. Users will be able to generate a list of the 
average time an issue stays open for all products. We 
believe this feature will enable software developers and 
managers to have more information to use when giving 
estimates, aiding them in making accurate predictions.


In regard to the authentication of users, future versions 
of the system will validate the employee or guest credentials
before granting access to a user. The validation of the user
will also grant certain permissions based on whether the 
user is logging in as an employee or as a guest.
